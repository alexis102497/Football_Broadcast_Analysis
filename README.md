# Football_Broadcast_Analysis

This project analyzes how broadcasting revenue distribution affects competitive balance across the top four European football leagues: Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and Bundesliga.

Using a dataset of club-level revenue and league titles over the past 11 years, the analysis investigates whether financial advantage translates into dominanceâ€”and how fairly different leagues distribute their broadcasting income.
